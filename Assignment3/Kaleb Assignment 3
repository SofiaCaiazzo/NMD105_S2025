This one was hard to get the crumb to fall, but with help from others I was able to get the proper variables to work. making the variables was the easy part. but getting them all to cooperate in a sketch was difficult

For this sketch the main thing I added was the mouseIsPressed function that made the ghost turn a tan color. and the ability to make the crumb fall at random

The main difficulty I had with this one was making the seed fall on a loop at a constant speed. with a little help from my peers I was able to create a function that allowed another crumb to fall when the pre-existing one had passed a certain point

This one wasn't all that different from the others.. the only difference was that mouseIsPressd was N/A as the ghost was now tan no matter what

I had to do a lot of rearanging and looking things up to make this game a reality. the object is just to catch the crumb with the ghost. and when a player does that the ghost turns tan. showing the player that they had caught the crumb
