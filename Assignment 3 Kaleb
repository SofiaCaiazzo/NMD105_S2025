The Hardest thing about this one was that it was hard to get the different flowers to code correctly and fpr the positions to not be overlapping. But after some messing around and assistance I managed to get this all up and running. The best part about writing with this is that i learned how to add different sprites in different ways

The challenges about that one was getting this one to work was the offset commands to work the correct way.. I had to get help from the professor in order to get them to work. After that I decided to add a couple more flowers to the mix to seee if they would work... they did not. So I took them out in order to make them properly work

Ok this one was by far the easiest one as all I had to do was add a command for random dots and that was easy as is
